# Learning a new programming language

Learning a new programming language for those who already know how to program can be a vague task. When do you know that you "know" the language enough to actually take on some work with that language?

Here is a repo where my answer is that you should be able to comfortably solve a few common problems in that language.

## Problems

1. *Line formatter*: Take `stdin` and format it so that only each line is only 80chars long.
2. *FFT*: Compute the DFT of a sequence by use of the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm. Should take list input from `stdin` and output results to `stdout`.
3. *Sieve of Erastosthanes*: A prime number calculation algorithm. Should take input from `stdin` of a number $n$ where $n>1$. Output should be to `stdout`, which should be a list of prime numbers where $p \in \{2, 3, ... , n\}$.
4. *Euclidean Algorithm*: Input should be $>2$ numbers from `stdin` and output should be to `stdout` where the `gcd()` is computed for all permutations of numbers in the input.
